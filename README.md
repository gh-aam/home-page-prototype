# Home Page Prototype
This project is a simple prototype of a home page designed to practice and learn HTML and CSS. It includes various elements such as a header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer.

## Features
- Clean and minimalist design
- Basic web structure using HTML5
- Custom styling with CSS3

**Note** that this webpage is not responsive as it was not a requirement from [FWD, 3rd Edition](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/fundamentals-of-web-development/P200000003214/9780136792857) during learning. So, open it on a larger screen.
